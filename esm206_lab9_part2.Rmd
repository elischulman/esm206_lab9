knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
```

```{r}
lizards <- read_csv(here("data", "lizards.csv"))
```

Get counts of lizards by species 
```{r}
lizards %>% 
  count(spp) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
```

Make a subset:
```{r}
utst <- lizards %>% 
  filter(spp == "UTST",
         site %in% c("IBPE", "RABB", "EAST"),
         tail %in% c("W", "B"))
